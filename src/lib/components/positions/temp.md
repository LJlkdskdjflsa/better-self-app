To add pagination to the PositionsList component, you'll need to modify the component to handle fetching data with pagination and render pagination controls. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:
Update the API Call to Support Pagination: Modify the fetch functions (fetchPositions and fetchDeletedPositions) to accept pagination parameters (e.g., page and pageSize).
Add Pagination State to the Component: Include state variables for managing the current page, page size, and pagination data received from the API.
Fetch Data with Pagination: Use the pagination state variables when fetching data.
Render Pagination Controls: Add UI elements to navigate between pages.Here's how you can implement these steps:### Step 1: Update API CallsAssuming fetchPositions and fetchDeletedPositions use the makeRequest function from api.ts, modify them to accept page and pageSize parameters and include these in the request URL.### Step 2: Add Pagination State
PositionsList.tsx
;

### Step 3: Fetch Data with PaginationModify the fetchData function inside useEffect to include currentPage and pageSize when calling the fetch functions. Also, update the state with pagination data from the response.

PositionsList.tsx
;

### Step 4: Render Pagination ControlsYou can use Chakra UI components or any other library for pagination controls. Here's a simple example using buttons:

PositionsList.tsx

> Remember to add the currentPage and pageSize to the dependency array of the useEffect hook to refetch data when these values change.This guide provides a basic implementation of pagination. Depending on your requirements, you might need to adjust the UI, handle edge cases, or optimize performance further.
